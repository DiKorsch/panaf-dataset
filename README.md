# The Pan-African Dataset

The Pan-African dataset is the largest and most diverse open-access video dataset of great apes in the wild. The dataset comprises âˆ¼20,000 videos and was curated from footage gathered at 18 study sites spanning several African countries. The dataset comprises frame-by-frame annotations for full-body location, intra-video ape identification (i.e. tracking data), species classification and basic behaviour/action. The video footage was originally collected by the Max Plank Institute (MPI) as part of the Pan African Programme, originally established to better understand the evolutionary-ecological drivers of behavioral diversity in great apes.

## Installation

Install [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). Then create a conda environment using the environment file (conda-environment.yml) using the following command.

```bash
conda env create --name envname --file=conda-environment.yml
```

Activate this conda environment:

```bash
conda activate envname
```

This should install the requisite packages.
